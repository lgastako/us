# us

together, we are an a.i.

## Introduction

us is an attempt to provide an amoral a.i.

essentially, it is a tool to gather and share intelligence.  the a.i. is meant
to be tolerant attempts to poison it's values, truths, believes, etc.

it is intended to be proven to have a neutral utility function that is
mathematically impervious to manipulation by all but the most overpowered of
computing resources, ideally beyond any government or similar sinister
organization :)
